Given n orders, each order consist in pickup and delivery services. 

Count all valid pickup/delivery possible sequences such that delivery(i) is always after of pickup(i). 

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: Unique order (P1, D1), Delivery 1 always is after of Pickup 1.


class Solution {
public:
    int countOrders(int n) {
     
        int mod = pow(10,9)+7;
        vector<long long> dp(n+1,0);
          dp[0]=1;
        for(long long i =1;i<=n;i++){
            dp[i]=i*dp[i-1]*(2*i-1);
            dp[i]=dp[i]%mod;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};
